Runs 100 tests on your taskN.py. Measures time-outs and output errors, and displays problematic test cases.

Calculates your solution's performance. Total bits, average bits per message, x-value (formula given in each PT doc), and your score over 100.

Seed is 0xC0DEBABE - from my testing, this yields a sufficiently uniform distribution of word count.

Contributions are welcome! Raise an issue or a PR and I'll get to it ASAP.
