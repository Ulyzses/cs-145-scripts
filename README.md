Scripts for testing CS 145 2324B Programming Tasks. 

## What is it
<img width="431" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 2 15 40 PM" src="https://github.com/jproads/cs-145-scripts/assets/93178783/f9f6c2b5-5523-4248-a84f-520284c3a37b">

Runs 100 tests on your taskN.py. Measures time-outs and output errors, and displays problematic test cases. Calculates your solution's performance. Total bits, average bits per message, x-value (formula given in each PT doc), and your score over 100.

Seed is `0xC0DEBABE` - from my testing, this yields a sufficiently uniform distribution of word count.

## How to use
1. For PT number `n` (`n = 0, 1`), download `test[n].py` and place in your `task[n]attachments` folder.
2. **Important:** In your terminal, navigate to `task[n]attachments/` and run `python3 test[n].py`.

## Extra
Contributions are welcome! Raise an issue or a PR and I'll get to it ASAP.
